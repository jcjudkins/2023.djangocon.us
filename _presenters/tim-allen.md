Tim joined [Wharton Research Data Services](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/)
in 2008, after working for local companies and starting a few of his own. Having
started programming at age six, he is currently an organizer of the Philadelphia
Python Users Group, Code for Recovery, and a member of the Python Software Foundation
and Django Software Foundation. Tim enjoys playing very loud guitar with lots of pedals,
is an avid cyclist, was
[the first person to sell real world items for virtual microcurrency](https://www.mtv.com/news/g3te5b/finally-you-can-buy-something-real-with-play-money)
long before Bitcoin, and enjoys beating his head against brick walls (as demonstrated
by his passion for coding, cycling in Philadelphia, and never-ending quest to get his
cat to behave). A life-long Philadelphia resident, he graduated from the University
of Pennsylvania in 1996 with an individualized major, “Computer Aided Information Acquisition”.
